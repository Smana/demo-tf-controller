## üîÑ Flux Dependencies matter

```mermaid

    Namespaces-->CRDs;

    CloudResources-->Security;
    Security-->Applications;
```

This diagram can be hard to understand so these are the key information:

* **Namespaces** are the first resources to be created, all other resources may be namespace scoped
* **CRDs** that allow to extend Kubernetes capabilities must be present in order to use them in all other applications when needed (Including Tofu controller CRDs)
* **Cloud resources** may be required by applications. For instance the [EPI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-identities.html) give permissions to AWS services.
* **Security** defines `external-secrets` that are needed by some applications in order to start.


## üß™ CI

2 things are checked

* The Opentofu code quality, conformance and security using [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform).
* The kustomize and Kubernetes conformance using kubeconform and building the kustomize configuration.

In order to run the CI checks locally just run the following command

‚ÑπÔ∏è It requires [task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) to be installed

```console
 task check
```

The same tasks are run in `Github Actions`.
